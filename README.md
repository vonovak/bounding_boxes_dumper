## bounding boxes dumper
This node dumps the bounding boxes from `upper_body_detector` (along with corresponding rgb&depth image, camera info and odomery) to the directory of your choice based on the `dump_path` parameter (see launchfile). Inside the directory, the file names are given by timestamps of the rbg images.
